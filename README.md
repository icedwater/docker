# Docker

Here are a bunch of docker files which we can use to set up various components
running on top of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Wait a minute, what's Docker?

Docker is a container platform which allows one to develop and distribute apps
in self-contained environments. That means less hassle with dependencies: when
you have to install them you can specify exactly what you need in a text file,
and this setup can be replicated exactly wherever it is needed.

However you need to have a 64-bit operating system if you're using [Ubuntu][1]
with docker. I don't know why yet. The kernel version should be at least 3.10.

be using just yet.)
